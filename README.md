# Digital Archaeology and Data Reuse

As social science disciplines increasingly move towards reliance on digital datasets for recording, research, accessibility, and archiving, it is now incumbent upon developing scholars to be familiar with the ways in which digital data can used, and how they are impacting research practices. This course provided students with a space to develop their digital literacy in archaeological contexts. We used a combination of lecture, discussions, and computer work to engage students in ways to create, manage, combine, and reuse archaeological data, while also confronting emerging issues in the field related to the increased use of digital technologies: data accuracy, data ethics, ownership, open data, public engagement, ‘big data.’ There are no expectations of a coding or data analysis background - this course was about exploration and experimentation. Students were not expected to emerge from this course with a complete knowledge of how to perform complex analyses on digital datasets – rather, this course instilled an underlying framework for how to think about archaeology and the data that archaeologists produce. It fostered an understanding of the principles that are beginning to guide archaeological research in the 21st century.

This course was funded by the Alexandria Archive Institute (AAI), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (EIN: 9102146202). AAI has received an Infrastructure and Capacity-Building Challenge Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities which provides funding for the AAI’s activities for ten years, until December of 2028. A key aim of the program is to develop data literacy among students and other practitioners of archaeology. To this end, a portion of the AAI’s annual budget is earmarked for developing a Data Literacy Program, which will include a variety of approaches, such as workshops, full courses, and fellowships. This course was a part of this program, working to develop principles of archaeological data literacy and reuse.

## Student Learning Outcomes:
Following the completion of this course, students will:
- Be able to access and collect data from open sources.
- Know the basics of data management and curation.
- Have knowledge of the methods for utilizing, visualizing, and performing analyses on digital data.
- Be able to knowledgeably assess published digital archaeological datasets.
- Know the different techniques for capturing 3D data and disseminating those data.
- Be familiar with the broad discussions in archaeology surrounding the use of digital technologies and be able to engage productively in them.
